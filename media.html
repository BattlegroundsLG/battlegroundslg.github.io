      <h2>How it works</h2>
      <p>Battlegrounds uses two different networking systems, as well as infrared lasers, to make live gaming possible.</p>
      <p>A short range radio (1) wirelessly connects the player’s vest and gun together, eliminating the awkward tether found on other laser tag systems.</p>
      <p>Each gun connects to the central server over a Wi-Fi radio (2), which provides high   bandwidth and fast response times. There are no visible antennas for either radio.</p>
      <p>Players tag each other with infrared lasers (3) which carry a data- packet identifying who shot who and with what weapon profile. Accurate up to 700ft.</p>
