  <p>We're a team of gamers, miscreants, pirates and ne'er-do-wells that share a love of virtual and live gaming. We have set out to completely revolutionize live gaming by combining the best elements of combat sports (paintball and airsoft) and modern video games (Halo, Call of Duty). We have a diverse background of engineering, computer science, design and entrepreneurship.</p>
