  <p>We're a high-performance team of gamers, miscreants, pirates and ne'er-do-wells that share a love of virtual and physical gaming. We have calculated every possible scenario thanks to our history of entrepreneurial efforts, and our diverse background of engineering, computer science, and design.</p>
  <p>Despite our differences, we've all united under one mission; to create the next revolution in physical gaming by building the most advanced laser tag gaming platform on the planet.</p>
