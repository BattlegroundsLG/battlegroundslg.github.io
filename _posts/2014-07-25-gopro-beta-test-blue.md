Raw GoPro footage from a recent beta test game.

10 minute King of the Hill game, the first 60 seconds of Blue Team's start.

3 sample weapon modes are being used for beta testing: **Assault Rifle**, **Shotgun** and **Laser Rifle**. Pressing the respawn button at the blue home base brings the player back into the game.
