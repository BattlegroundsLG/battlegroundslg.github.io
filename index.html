  <h4>Our mission at Battlegrounds is to build an advanced technology laser tag facility that creates a live gaming experience inspired by our love of video games.</h4>

  <p>We share a love of video games as well as combat sports - Halo and Mass Effect to paintball and airsoft. Weâ€™ve seen video games evolve considerably over the last 15 years, while objective-based combat sports have not.</p>

  <p>Laser tag and paintball do not offer the kind of rich, interactive experience that people have come to expect from video games.</p>

  <p>We have set out to make Battlegrounds a tightly integrated combination of:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>Advanced player hardware</li>
    <li>A networked, interactive playing field</li>
    <li>A highly detailed and customizable player experience</li>
    <li>A social centre, where players can connect, compete and build a community</li>
  </ul>

<p>Through team-based competitive play, individual stat tracking, responsive field objectives, and force-feedback player hardware, we are creating a brand-new live gaming experience previewing in September 2014 and launching 2015.</p>
