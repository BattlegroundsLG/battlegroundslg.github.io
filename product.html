      <h2>How it works</h2>
      <p>Battlegrounds uses two different networking systems, as well as infrared lasers, to make live gaming possible.</p>
      <p>A short range radio (1) wirelessly connects the playerâ€™s vest and gun together, eliminating the awkward tether found on other laser tag systems.</p>
      <p>Each gun connects to the central server over a Wi-Fi radio (2), which provides high   bandwidth and fast response times. There are no visible antennas for either radio.</p>
      <p>Players tag each other with infrared lasers (3) which carry a data- packet identifying who shot who and with what weapon profile. Accurate up to 700ft.</p>

      <h3>Player Equipment</h3>
      <p>Each player wears a vest (1) which shows their team color and reports hits from other players. When a player is hit, multi-color LEDs flash and force feedback units vibrate.
    An optional head sensor (2) and electric shock force-on-force simulator can be added for more serious players.</p>
      <p>Each player wears a silicone RFID bracelet (3). Just by touching their wrist to a device, players can interact with intelligent field props, information kiosks and the point- of-sale system.</p>
